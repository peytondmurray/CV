abstract = {The first order reversal curve (FORC) method is a magnetometry based technique used to capture nanoscale magnetic phase separation and interactions with macroscopic measurements using minor hysteresis loop analysis. This makes the FORC technique a powerful tool in the analysis of complex systems which cannot be effectively probed using localized techniques. However, recovering quantitative details about the identified phases which can be compared to traditionally measured metrics remains an enigmatic challenge. We demonstrate a technique to reconstruct phase-resolved magnetic hysteresis loops by selectively integrating the measured FORC distribution. From these minor loops, the traditional metrics—including the coercivity and saturation field, and the remanent and saturation magnetization—can be determined. In order to perform this analysis, special consideration must be paid to the accurate quantitative management of the so-called reversible features. This technique is demonstrated on three representative materials systems, high anisotropy FeCuPt thin-films, Fe nanodots, and SmCo/Fe exchange spring magnet films, and shows excellent agreement with the direct measured major loop, as well as the phase separated loops.},

@article{DeToro2017,
abstract = {Remanence magnetization plots (e.g., Henkel or $\delta$M plots) have been extensively used as a straightforward way to determine the presence and intensity of dipolar and exchange interactions in assemblies of magnetic nanoparticles or single domain grains. Their evaluation is particularly important in functional materials whose performance is strongly affected by the intensity of interparticle interactions, such as patterned recording media and nanostructured permanent magnets, as well as in applications such as hyperthermia and magnetic resonance imaging. Here we demonstrate that $\delta$M plots may be misleading when the nanoparticles do not have a homogeneous internal magnetic configuration. Substantial dips in the $\delta$M plots of $\gamma$-Fe2O3 nanoparticles isolated by thick SiO2 shells indicate the presence of demagnetizing interactions, usually identified as dipolar interactions. Our results, however, demonstrate that it is the inhomogeneous spin structure of the nanoparticles, as most clearly evidenced by M{\"{o}}ssbauer measu...},

abstract = {Magnetization reversal of interconnected Kagome artificial spin ice was studied by the first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique based on the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetoresistance measurements. The magnetization reversal exhibits a distinct six-fold symmetry with the external field orientation. When the field is parallel to one of the nano-bar branches, the domain nucleation/propagation and annihilation processes sensitively depend on the field cycling history and the maximum field applied. When the field is nearly perpendicular to one of the branches, the FORC measurement reveals the magnetic interaction between the Dirac strings and orthogonal branches during the magnetization reversal process. Our results demonstrate that the FORC approach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the magnetic interaction in the magnetization reversal processes of spin-frustrated systems.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {Magnetoelectric coupling in ferromagnetic/multiferroic systems is often manifested in the exchange bias effect, which may have combined contributions from multiple sources, such as domain walls, chemical defects, or strain. In this study we magnetically “fingerprint” the coupling behavior of CoFe grown on epitaxial BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films by magnetometry and the first-order-reversal-curves (FORC). The contribution to exchange bias from 71°, 109° and charged ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) was elucidated by the FORC distribution. CoFe samples grown on BFO with 71° DWs only exhibit an enhancement of the coercivity, but little exchange bias. Samples grown on BFO with 109° DWs and mosaic DWs exhibit a much larger exchange bias, with the main enhancement attributed to 109° and charged DWs. Based on the Malozemoff random field model, a varying-anisotropy model is proposed to account for the exchange bias enhancement. This work sheds light on the relationship between the exchange bias effect of the CoFe/BFO heterointerface and the ferroelectric DWs, and provides a path for multiferroic device analysis and design.},
